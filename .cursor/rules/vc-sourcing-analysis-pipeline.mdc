# VC Sourcing Pipeline & Scoring

## Pipeline Architecture

**4-Phase Approach:**
1. **Discovery** - Filter DevOps repos from OSS Insight trending data
2. **Enrichment** - Gather README and community data via GitHub/Exa APIs  
3. **Analysis** - LLM analysis of README quality and community sentiment
4. **Scoring** - Multi-factor scoring system with transparent rubric

## Repository Filtering

**Source:** OSS Insight `/trends/repos` endpoint
**Filter:** Match `collection_names` against DevOps collections (identified by LLM)
**Output:** Deduplicated dictionary of potential leads

## Scoring Framework

**Transparent Multi-Factor Rubric:**
- **Popularity** - GitHub stars (normalized)
- **README Quality** - Clarity score, painkiller vs vitamin assessment
- **Time-to-Value** - How quickly developers can get results
- **Community Sentiment** - HackerNews/Reddit sentiment analysis

## Parallel Processing

**Concurrent Analysis:** Run README and sentiment analysis in parallel using `asyncio.gather()`
**Graceful Degradation:** Continue with partial data if some analyses fail
**Cost Tracking:** Monitor OpenAI API usage throughout pipeline

## Progress Reporting

Use emoji indicators for clear status tracking:
- 🔍 Analyzing
- ✅ Success  
- ⚠️ Warning
- ❌ Failure
