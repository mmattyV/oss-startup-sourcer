# VC Sourcing Data Models & Analysis

## Structured Data Models

Use **Pydantic models** for all LLM outputs:

**Core Models:**
- `READMEAnalysis` - Clarity score, problem solved, time-to-wow, painkiller vs vitamin
- `SentimentAnalysis` - Community sentiment, key quotes, criticisms  
- `FinalAnalysis` - Container for all analysis results plus calculated score

## LLM Analysis Framework

**Structured Output:** Always use `call_openai_structured()` with Pydantic models
**Model:** Use `o4-mini` for cost-effective structured analysis
**Prompts:** Create system prompts that position LLM as "expert VC analyst"

## Analysis Components

**README Analysis:**
- Assess clarity and problem definition
- Estimate time-to-value for developers
- Identify if it solves "painkiller" vs "vitamin" problems

**Community Sentiment:**
- Search HackerNews/Reddit via Exa API
- Extract sentiment and key community feedback
- Identify common criticisms

**Content Handling:**
- Truncate content to fit LLM context limits (15k chars)
- Handle missing/corrupted data gracefully
